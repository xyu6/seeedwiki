This is version 3.0 of GPRS Shield.
Hook your Arduino up to GSM/GPRS cell phone network with GPRS shield! You can use your Arduino/Seeeduino or other main boards to dial a phone number or send a text to your friend via easy to use AT commands now.
GPRS Shield features a quad-band low power consumption GSM/GPRS module SIM900 as well as a compact PCB antenna.Meanwhile, improvements on interfaces and basic circuit have been taken to make it more concise and reliable.
And thereâ€™re two choices for you to communicate GPRS shield with the main board -- UART or SoftwareSerial.
